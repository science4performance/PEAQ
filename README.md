**Personal Energy Availability Questionnaire (PEAQ)**

https://mypeaq.streamlit.app/

The personal energy availability questionnaire (PEAQ) is designed to assess your energy availability status. 

*What is Energy Availability?*
Matching your energy intake to your energy demands helps you reach your personal peak health and exercise performance. Failing to meet your energy demands results in low energy availability. This increases your risk of developing relative energy deficiency (REDs) and its adverse health and performance consequences.


*PEAQ - Personal Energy Availability Questionnaire*
People of any age, whatever their level and type of exercise, can be at risk of developing REDs; from elite dancers and athletes to recreational exercisers. The PEAQ will guide you through a series of questions about exercise, physical characteristics, nutrition, hormone function and well-being. It just takes a few minutes.


*Benefits of the PEAQ*
Your personal report instantly generates a REDs Risk Score and provides valuable insights into your energy status and potential risks, along with guidance. The PEAQ is intended for those 16 years of age and over.
The PEAQ has been used in several published research studies; however, it is not a substitute for seeking medical advice. Dr Nicky Keay offers personalised health advisory appointments https://nickykeayfitness.com/appointments/.
